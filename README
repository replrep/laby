WHAT IS IT ?

Jankas Labyrinth Spiel is another small game I wrote for my
daughter Janka. Here you can collect letters in a labyrinth to
form short words. It is simple, but Janka liked it (she is three
years old now).

If you or your child find this game interesting, have a look at
http://www.cbrunzema.de/software.html. There you'll find another game,
Jankas gelbes Mondgesicht Spiel, which you may like, too.


INSTALLATION

You need python and Tkinter for "Jankas Labyrinth Spiel". Have
a look at http://www.python.org. I used python and Tkinter
version 2.4.4, other versions may work...
If you have python and Tkinter installed, un-gzip and un-tar
laby-1.3.tar.gz, cd into laby-1.3, run laby.py.
Thats it on my GNU/linux machine. I don't know anything about
python/Tkinter under Win or MacOS, again, see http://www.python.org.
Please let me know if Jankas Labyrinth Spiel runs on anything else
than GNU/linux.

If you like to configure things, have a look at the beginning of
laby.py.


If you have any suggestions or comments, please drop me a mail.
