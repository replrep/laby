WHAT IS IT ?

Jankas Labyrinth Spiel is another small game I wrote for my
daughter Janka. Here you can collect letters in a labyrinth to
form short words. It is simple, but Janka liked it (she is three
years old now).


INSTALLATION

You need python and Tkinter for "Jankas Labyrinth Spiel". Have a look
at http://www.python.org. The latest version is updated to use python3
and Tkinter version 3.12.3, other versions may work... If you have
python and Tkinter installed (called python3-tk in debian/ubuntu
setups), download/clone the sources, cd into the directory and run
laby.py. Thats it on my GNU/linux machine. I don't know anything about
python/Tkinter under Win or MacOS, again, see http://www.python.org.
Please let me know if Jankas Labyrinth Spiel runs on anything else
than GNU/linux.

If you like to configure things, have a look at the beginning of
laby.py.


If you have any suggestions or comments, please drop me a mail.
